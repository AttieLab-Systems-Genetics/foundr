## Shiny app.R organization

This package has Shiny app routines organized in a modular fashion.
The main deployment 
[app.R](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/app.R)
(located in the `inst/shinyApp` folder) is very short, calling `foundr` package routines
[ui()](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/ui.R)
and
[server()](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/server.R).
The `server()` in turn calls the following [moduleServer](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/1.7.0/moduleserver) modules,
which correspond to the tab panels:

- [shinyTraitPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitPanel.R)
- [shinyContrastPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastPanel.R)
- [shinyTimePanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimePanel.R)
- [shinyStatsPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyStats.R)

Each of these in turn call additional modules. 
See the following for more information on Shiny modules:

- [Modularizing Shiny app code](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/)
- [Mastering Shiny reactivity](https://mastering-shiny.org/reactivity-intro.html)

Most `foundr` modules have their own "unit test" applets,
located in the `inst/shinyApp` folder. 
It turns out that having `app.R` in the folder `inst/shinyApp` enables one to
run other apps in that same folder. Hence it is possible to unit test parts of
the Shiny app. [There may be other Shiny tools to debug, but this is quite handy.]
For instance, the panel applets are:

- [appTraitPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appTraitPanel.R)
- [appContrastPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appContrastPanel.R)
- [appTimePanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appTimePanel.R)
- [appStatsPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appStats.R)

## Modules called by panel modules

Each of the panel modules calls further modules as follows
(with links on first mention)

- `TraitPanel`
  - [shinyTraitOrder](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitOrder.R)
  - [shinyTraitNames](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitNames.R) (key trait name)
  - [shinyCorTable](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyCorTable.R)
  - `shinyTraitNames` (related trait names)
  - [shinyCorPlot](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyCorPlot.R)
  - [shinyTraitTable](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitTable.R)
  - [shinyTraitSolos](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitSolos.R)
  - [shinyTraitPairs](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitPairs.R)
  - [shinyDownloads](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyDownloads.R)
- `StatsPanel`
  - [shinyContrastPlot](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastPlot.R)
    - `shinyDownloads`
- `TimePanel`
  - [shinyTimeTable](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimeTable.R)
    - [shinyTimeTraits](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimeTraits.R)
  - [shinyTimePlot](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimePlot.R)
    - `shinyDownloads`
- `ContrastPanel`
  - [shinyContrastTable](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastTable.R)
    - `shinyTraitOrder`
  - [shinyContrastSex](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastSex.R)
    - `shinyContrastPlot`
      - `shinyDownloads`
  - `shinyContrastTable` (for contrasts over time)
  - [shinyContrastTime](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastTime.R)
    - `shinyTimeTraits`
  - `shinyTimePlot`
    - `shinyDownloads`
  - [shinyContrastModule](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastModule.R)
    - `shinyContrastPlot`
      - `shinyDownloads`

Notice that modules enable code reuse and reduction of
code duplication.
The `TraitNames` module is reused for the key trait
and related trait names in the `Trait` panel.
Download mechanics for all panels are handled by the `shinyDownloads` module.
The `shinyContrastPlot` module used by the `Stats` panel for plots and tables is reused twice in the `Contrast` panel,
for the `ContrastSex` and `ContrastModule` sub-panels.
The `shinyTimePlot` and `shinyTimeTraits` modules used by the `Time` panel are
reused for the `ContrastTime` sub-panel of the `Contrast` panel.
The `shinyContrastTable` is used twice in the `Contrast` panel for traits on their own and traits measured over time.

It is important to note that `module` is used here in two ways--for Shiny modules via `moduleServer()` and for dimension-reduction "modules" constructed of traits via [WGCNA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WGCNA).
The `ContrastModule` Shiny module handles both WGCNA module eigentraits (`eigens()`) and traits within a WGCNA module (`traits()`); this is done currently with `if` logic, but might be modularized further later.

Another place where modularization could be leveraged is in the
`ContrastPlot` module, which uses `if` and `switch` logic for
various types of plots (`volcano`, `biplot`, `dotplot`, and maybe more). This begs some module redesign in the future.

## Input parameters

The Shiny app includes multiple input parameters, which change other features
of the app. Some of these are at the level of the `ui()`, possibly through `server()`-side reactives. Others are within panel modules or buried deeper.
The design is meant to have parameters at the appropriate level,
near the visualizations that they adjust.

### Server-level input parameters

- `main_par$dataset` dataset(s) examined
- `main_par$strains` strain(s) included for plots
- `main_par$height` height of plots
- `main_par$facet` facet on strains if `TRUE`
- `main_par$tabpanel` current active tab panel

These input parameters are referred to as `input$xxx` in the `server()` module,
but are passed as a set to other modules as `main_par$xxx`.

### Panel-level input parameters

Input parameters in the panel and other modules are local to each module,
but in some cases are passed on to subsequent modules. the `moduleServer()`
technology requires that their input selection us a namespace through the `ns()` device. See
[Modularizing Shiny app code](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/)
for details.

Persistence of values and cross-reference is tricky.
It helps to use `reactiveVal()` but need care.

- `TraitPanel`
  - `TraitOrderInput` dataset(s) and order
  - `TraitNamesUI` key trait
  - `reldataset` dataset(s)
  - `TrainnamesUI` related traits
  - `CorTableUI`
  - `mincor` minimum correlation
- `StatsPanel`
  - `ContrastPlotInput`
  - `ContrastPlotUI`
- `TimePanel`
  - `TimeTableInput`
- `ContrastPanel`
  - `TraitOrderInput` via `ContrastTable` for dataset(s) and order
  - `ContrastTableInput` for `Sex`, `Module` and `Time` sub-panels
  - `ContratsTimeInput` for `Time` sub-panel


#### dataset parameter

For `main_par$dataset`, I am finding the following behavior so far:

- `TraitPanel`
  + `dataset` set in `TraitOrderInput`
  + change `dataset` does not change in Contrast or Stats panels
  + change persists when switching back
- `StatsPanel` 
  + `main_par$dataset` with local `reactiveVal()`
  + change `dataset` does not change in Trait or Contrast panels
  + change does not persist when going to Trait or Contrast and back
- `TimesPanel`
  + `main_par$dataset` with local `reactiveVal()`
  + uses its own system similar to Contrast/Time
- `ContrastPanel` 
  + `dataset` set in `TraitOrderInput` via `ContrastTable`
  + change `dataset` does not change in Trait or Stats panels
  + change in Sex subpanel persists for Module subpanel and vice versa
  + Time subpanel is handled on its own (for now)
  + change does not persist when going to Trait or Stats and back
  
More information:

- The `server()` sets `input$dataset`, which is passed to all panels, but not necessarily used by them (yet).
- `TraitPanel` uses `input$keydataset` from within `TraitOrder`. That module uses `reactiveVal` to ensure persistence, but it is not available per se outside.
- `ContrastPanel` calls `ContrastTable`, which calls `TraitOrder`.
- `StatsPanel` uses `input$dataset` from `server()`.
- `TimePanel` uses its own system.

It might be possible to move the `TraitOrder` version up to using the `server`.
However, need to be careful about logic.
