Multiparent Founder Study Tools

This package can be used on its own for analysis and visualization of founder data, or to build a web app. The default app ([inst/shinyApp/app.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/app.R)) is publicly installed at
<https://data-viz.it.wisc.edu/FounderStudy> (and soon moving to
<https://rstudio.it.wisc.edu/FounderStudy>).

Specialized instances are being developed for particular studies. See code in
