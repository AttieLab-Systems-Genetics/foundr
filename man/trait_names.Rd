\usage{
trait_names(object, traitnames = NULL, sep = ": ")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{}

\item{traitnames}{names of traits, possibly including dataset name with separator}

\item{sep}{}
}
\value{
vector of trait names prepended by dataset if appropriate
}
\description{
Trait names are distinct within a dataset, but may be duplicated in
different datasets (for instance same type of trait in two tissues).
The `object` will have a column `dataset` if it comprises multiple
datasets, but it is also possible that the `dataset` column is absent
(in case there is only one dataset).
}
\details{
The argument `traitnames` can be one of the following:
1. names found in `trait` column that are distinct across any possible datasets.
2. name of the form `dataset: trait`, that is, separated by the `sep` string.
3. data frame with columns for `dataset` and `trait`, with one row entry per traitname.
4. NULL, in which case all `datatraits` in `object` are returned
}
\examples{
trait_names(sampleData, c("A","C"))
}
